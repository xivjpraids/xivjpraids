## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Naming]</b> Why is the tier abbreviated with "M" instead of "A" or "R"?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>When <em>The Arcadion</em> was announced, the immediate problem was
      what letter to use to abbreviate the tier as A1S - A12S is already used 
      for Alexander.</p>
      <p>There was brief discussion to differentiate the two with a scheme 
      like "Ar1-4S", but that was quickly deemed unpalatable. Instead, the 
      letter "R" was proposed because "R" was the second letter in 
      "Arcadion", and "Ar" sounds like the letter "R" anyway.</p>
      <p>However, when the tier landed and we learned the full names of each 
      encounter, there was a debate over whether to use "R" or "M", 
      given "M1", "M2", etc. was in the name of each encounter.</p>
      <p>That being said, there were two possible naming conventions the 
      development team would use for the subsequent tiers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AAC Cruiserweight M1 <em>(following Omega)</em></li>
        <li>AAC Cruiserweight M5 <em>(following Pandæmonium)</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Without knowing ahead of time which scheme the development team 
      would take, I chose to go with "M" instead of "R" because while 
      both "R5S" and "M5S" are workable if the first encounter of the second 
      tier is named "AAC Cruiserweight M1", only "M5S" really works if it 
      were named "AAC Cruiserweight M5" instead.</p>
