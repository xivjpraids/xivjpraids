# Hell on Rails (Extreme)

[Game8](https://game8.jp/ff14/750586) has gone with Nukemaru's strategy that
cheeses *Arcane Revelation* with 2:6 stacks + heavy mitigation.

*However*, this doesn't seem to have fully caught on just yet- PF will often
advertise for this 2:6 *Arcane Revelation* strat ("魔法陣２６"),
but when queueing via RF, it's more common to do *Arcane Revelation* normally
instead.

## 2:6 "Braindead" Arcane Revelation

Notably, *Arcane Revelation* is resolved with 2:6 stacks and heavy mitigation.
Because the party may end up with multiple *Vulnerability Up* debuffs, the 2nd
and 3rd towers are invulned by the tanks instead.
