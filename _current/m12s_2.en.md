## Idyllic Dream

*Idyllic Dream* is the capstone mechanic of this encounter, spanning over three
minutes. It is essentially a souped-up version of *Replication #2*, executed
while crossing between two worlds.

This section just goes through the steps needed to resolve *Idyllic Dream*.

Nukemaru has also compiled several *Idyllic Dream* runs that you can reference.

### Idyllic Dream Macros

Each player will need to prepare a set of eight macros to mark themselves with,
one for each position they could be standing in.

These can also come with `/echo` reminders to help remember what you're
supposed to do.

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Click to Expand] Idyllic Dream Macros</b></summary>

These macros are to be pressed in Step 4 below, which is where you move to the
clone you are tethered to, <b>after</b> you have potentially swapped positions in Step 3.

```

/e Swap tether with [2] if needed
/e 　※ If you swapped → Defamation first

      above, they do so in two waves- cardinal vs. intercardinal clones.</p>
      <p>However, because the base effects assigned in Step 6 alternate between
      4-man stacks and Defamations, if we did nothing, then <em>all</em> four
      4-man stacks, or all four Defamations would resolve together in Steps 16
      and 18, which is impossible to resolve successfully.</p>

      <p>So, the goal is to split the player clones and assign them effects
      like so- that way, each set of cardinal or intercardinal clones has two
      4-man stacks, and two Defamations.</p>

      <p>While the four players at the boundary (N, NE, SW, S) can exchange
      effects easily, the two pairs of players deep inside their half cannot
      (W, NW, and E, SE), because if they swapped, there would still be one
      clone with the opposite effect in that half of the arena.</p>
      <p>This is why there is a swap between the NW and E players at the start-
      this lets the now East player (who is assigning their effect to the NW
      clone) pick between the E and SE effects to give the NW clone the 4-man
      stack.</p>
      <p>Likewise, this lets the now NW player (who is assigning their effect
      to the East clone) to pick between the W and NW effects to give the East
      clone Defamation.</p>

    <td colspan="2">
      <p>The second swap between the South and SW players at the start
      technically isn't strictly necessary, as long as you remember that you
      want the SW clone to end with a stack, and the South clone with
      Defamation.</p>
      <p>However, swapping their positions in Step 3 unifies the tether swaps
      in Step 6- if one pair swaps tethers, then <em>all</em> pairs swap
      tethers.</p>
      <p>This makes things neater, easy to call out, and lets the SW and South
      players "follow everyone else" if they see everyone else doing something
      they're not.</p>
