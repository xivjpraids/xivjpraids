## Markers

The markers are used for orientation.

- `A` and `C` are particularly used for orientation for the fire tethers during 
  *Deep Aerial*.
- The `1234` markers are where the tank + melee further away from Deep Blue 
  stands when baiting Deep Blue's *Alley-oop Double-dip* or *Reverse Alley-oop* 
  during the split arena phase.
